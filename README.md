<p id='description'> In the first step it's an application to confirm the user is a local worker at the resort to the enterprise according to some discounts with QRcode </p>

<p id="description">My final objective is to build a social networking application for seasonal workers connecting them and giving them easy access to discounts in their resorts from participating businesses. 
  The application must have features like tchatting, marketplace, cp-driving system, threads, QRcode, job offer...Etc.
